# Statement of the Project

## **1. Problem Statement**

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, and early detection is crucial for preventing severe health complications.  
However, many individuals remain undiagnosed due to lack of awareness, insufficient access to medical testing, or delayed check-ups.

This project aims to provide a **quick, accessible, and data-driven method** to predict the likelihood of diabetes using basic medical parameters.  
By leveraging machine learning, the system assists users in identifying potential risk early and encourages timely medical consultation.

## **2. Scope of the Project**

The scope of this project includes:

- Developing a machine learning model to classify whether a user is likely diabetic or non-diabetic.
- Building an interactive **web-based application** using Streamlit for user input and result visualization.
- Providing graphical insights such as model performance metrics and feature importance.
- Allowing users to explore the underlying dataset interactively via charts.
- Enabling users to download a personalized prediction report.
- Ensuring fast, lightweight, and user-friendly operation without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

This project does **not** include medical diagnosis, treatment recommendation, or replacing professional healthcare evaluation.
